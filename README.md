# Daily Question: JavaScript loops

Consider the following code:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
  var theCounter = 15;
  while (theCounter > 0)
  {
    document.write("The count at this time is " + theCounter + "<br/>");
    theCounter--;
  }
</script>
```

### What is the expected result when you run this script in the browser?
A. There will be no visible output, but the script will count down to 0.

B. The script will output a countdown from 15 to 0 in the browser window.

C. The script will output a countdown from 15 to 1 in the browser window.

D. The script will output 15, then 1, because it will only write the first and last values of a ```while``` statement.

So for this one ive been trying everything under the sun to seeif these numbers print out in the console or even count down. I get a syntax error no matter what I do " < " and it makes me think there might be a small error somewhere in my work that i keep looking past. So I know this is a while loop and its counting down from 15 to 0 so that knocks out C and D. At least I think. Now this is a crap shoot, just because i absolutley in no way see numbers counting down on the console or anything, im going to have to go with A.

My choice is A.
